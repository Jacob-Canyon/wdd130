    <h2>Jacob Canyon</h2>
    <h3>Jakes</h3>
    <p> I was born in California and raise on the Navajo Nation. Currently I am living in Tempe Arizona. I am not married. I am the youngest of six kids. My family name Canyon comes from the Grand Canyon, since that is where my family lived. I am a member of the Navajo tribe.</p>
    <p>I work as a Tech Support Assistant at Shamley School. Before this I was a long term sub teaching technology. I was my first time in the classroom. It was a wonderful learning experince.</p>
    <p>I was born and raise in the Chruch, so that makes 35 years a member. I grew up in the small Cyrstal Branch in New Mexico. Strong members there who really help me to gain my own testimony.</p>
    <p>I am studying applied technologies. My plan is to become a teacher when I finish my degree. I come a family of teachers. My Uncle and Aunt both finished BYU pathways and became teachers.</p>
