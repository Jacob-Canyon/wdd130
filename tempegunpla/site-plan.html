        Welcome to Tempe Gunpla. Your local Gunpla Community.

We are the local Gunpla community in the Tempe Area. Both online and in person we build and share our love for all things Gunpla.

What is Gunpla? It is a model building from the popular anime series Mobile Suit Gundam. Each model kit is made of plastic injection molds. Each part is then cut out and put together, no gluing or painting  necessary! The only tool you need is a set of clippers. This does not mean you are limited to just following the instructions. Users can add a custom paint job, custom stickers or decals, or LED lights. For extra cool and unique design you can mix two or more different  model kits together in what is called a Kit Bash.

Not sure where to begin?Do not be intimated. This hobby is easier to get into than it looks. Check out our beginners guide to get yourself started. Our build nights are also a great way to get into the hobby. Come see how the models are built. We are happy to answer any questions and help you select the right tools and model kit to get you started.

Veteran builder looking for a challenge? We host build contests online and at our build nights. We have plenty of expert builders in our community so come and put your skills to the test. See what new and interesting kit bashes. Or learn about more advanced techniques. LED, custom paint jobs, we have them all.  

So where do we meet? Our home location is at Hobby Action in Chandler. They are also the sponsor of our build nights. They have the largest selection of Gunpla kits in the Valley. We regularly post when a new product has dropped. Stay in the loop for when new and premium products are available. They also have tools, bases and LED lights. Hobby Action has everything you need for your Gunpla builds, both basic and advanced.

      <h3>Beginners Guide</h3>
      <p>
        One of the greatest things about Gunpla is how easy it is to get started. All you need is a model kit and a pair of clippers! Selecting  a kit is not hard. There are Three main grades of kits in Gunpla. High Grade. These are simpler kits with less detail than the other grades. The upside is that they are cheap, with kits as low as $15 USD. Can be finished in two hours. Great for beginner builders. If you mess up, not much is lost. Next is Real Grade. These kits have an inner frame for greater movement of limbs and joints. They are more difficult than the High Grade kits. Last is Master Grade. The most complex and detailed of the kits available. Long build times. They can cost a pretty penny. Once you have selected your first kit, the only tool you will need is a pair of clippers. The box will have a construction manual and the parts will come in sheets. All of the parts are numbered in the sheets.  Simply find the parts in the manual and then cut it out. You will want to make your cut as close to the part as possible. The parts just pushed together, there is no need for glue. As a beginner you should only cut out the parts that you are currently using. This will reduce the chances of losing parts or the frustration of trying to tell which part is which. Often see that the cut leaves little stubs that can ruin the look of your model. There are very fancy files and sandpaper that can be used to remove these imperfections, just use a nail file. A couple of cheap emery boards and you can have nice clean lines. As you are putting parts together it is important to not use too much force. If the parts are not fitting, check to make sure that you have not left any stubs when cutting out the part, or make sure you are using the right parts. Take your time. Do not be afraid to stop and start at another time. In on time you will be building Master Grades like a pro.

Build Contest

We host two different kinds of contests. 1st is the build night contest. At the beginning of the month we select a build theme. Then there are three levels of builds, Expert , Advance, and Beginner. Each level has limits that can be done. These will be posted with the theme at the beginning of the month. Hobby Action has prizes for the winners. This is a great opportunity to get feedback on your skills.

The 2nd type of contest is the weekly online contest. Here you post pictures of the Gunpla builds on our Facebook group. Here members of the group vote for the best builds. After last week's contest closes we will announce the new theme for the Gunpla of the week. You can not use any build from a previous contest. Just tag your pics with the #Gunplaoftheweek and you are in the contest. You can also just post on any other build and get feedback or show off. Share your creativity with everyone else. This is also a great place to get help with tricky builds.
