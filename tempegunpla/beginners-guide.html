            <p class="guide-text">One of the greatest things about Gunpla is how easy it is to get started. All you need is a model kit and a pair of clippers! 
            </p>

            <img src="images/rsz_3selection.png" alt="kit selection">
            <p>Selecting  a kit is not hard. There are Three main grades of kits in Gunpla. High Grade. These are simpler kits with less detail than the other grades. The upside is that they are cheap, with kits as low as $15 USD. Can be finished in two hours. Great for beginner builders. If you mess up, not much is lost. Next is Real Grade. These kits have an inner frame for greater movement of limbs and joints. They are more difficult than the High Grade kits. Last is Master Grade. The most complex and detailed of the kits available. Long build times. They can cost a pretty penny. </p>
            
            <img src="images/rsz_starterkit.jpg" alt="starting">
            <p>Once you have selected your first kit, the only tool you will need is a pair of clippers.The box will have a construction manual and the parts will come in sheets. All of the parts are numbered in the sheets.  </p>
            
            <img src="images/rsz_clipping.jpg" alt="cutting part">
            <p>Simply find the parts in the manual and then cut it out. You will want to make your cut as close to the part as possible. </p>
            
            <img src="images/rsz_parts.png" alt="working with parts">
            <p>The parts just pushed together, there is no need for glue. As a beginner you should only cut out the parts that you are currently using. This will reduce the chances of losing parts or the frustration of trying to tell which part is which.
                Often see that the cut leaves little stubs that can ruin the look of your model. There are very fancy files and sandpaper that can be used to remove these imperfections, just use a nail file. A couple of cheap emery boards and you can have nice clean lines. As you are putting parts together it is important to not use too much force. If the parts are not fitting, check to make sure that you have not left any stubs when cutting out the part, or make sure you are using the right parts.
