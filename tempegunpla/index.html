            <p>We are the local Gunpla community in the Tempe Area. Both online and in person we build and share our love for all things Gunpla.
            </p>
            <p>What is Gunpla? It is a model building from the popular anime series Mobile Suit Gundam. Each model kit is made of plastic injection molds. Each part is then cut out and put together, no gluing or painting  necessary! The only tool you need is a set of clippers. This does not mean you are limited to just following the instructions. Users can add a custom paint job, custom stickers or decals, or LED lights. For extra cool and unique design you can mix two or more different  model kits together in what is called a Kit Bash.
            </p>
